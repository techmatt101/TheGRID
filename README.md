## About
Are you frustrated gamer, tired of trying to prove to your friends that you ‘pwned’ their high scores? Or maybe a Developer who does not have the experience or the time to create a server side application and database just to add a leaderboard to your game?
I would like to introduce ‘The GRID’. A social platform for players to share and compete with each other’s high scores across HTML5 games. Developers will be able to utilize this platform as an easy and efficient solution to include a leaderboard mechanic in their games without the necessity of setting up their own service, providing them with greater social interactions for their players.
The GRID, a dynamic Web Application designed for the modern day gamer, built using technologies including NodeJS, MongoDB.

## Vision
- Allow developers to easily integrate a leaderboard mechanic into their games without the necessity of setting up their own service.
- Providing players with a more social and competitive atmosphere using the online platform.
